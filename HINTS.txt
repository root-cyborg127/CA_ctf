Download the Image: The first step is to download the image provided for the challenge.

Open the Image: Open the image using an image viewer or editor to inspect it visually. Sometimes, you might find hints or hidden messages in the image itself.

Steganography: Steganography involves hiding information within an image. You'll need to use steganography techniques to extract the hidden data from the image.


Decode the Hidden Data: Use the appropriate steganography tool to decode the hidden data from the image.

Base64 Decoding: The result obtained from the steganography might be in base64 encoded format. You'll need to decode it to reveal the actual content.

SHA-256 Encoding: After decoding the base64 data, you'll likely find another Hashed. It's mentioned that this Hashed string is in SHA-256 

Decode the SHA-256 Hash 

Find the Flag: The decoded data, whether it's a plaintext or a hashed string, should lead you to the final flag. Once you have the flag, you can proceed to submit it to the submission page mentioned in the challenge description.

Submit the Flag: Visit the URL provided (http://localhost/ctf/main.php) and enter the flag into the submission box. If the flag is correct, you should receive confirmation that you have successfully completed the challenge.

Remember that during the CTF, you might encounter various challenges and puzzles, so always be ready to apply different techniques and approaches to solve them. Good luck, and have fun!
